After cloning a ~/vim_config folder will be created.

Run install.sh to complete instalation.
What this does is :
	- creates a symlink ~/.vim/ -> ~/vim_config # folder used for plugins, docs and colorschemes
	- creates ~/.gvimrc which sources ~/vim_config/gvimrc ( if it already exists, it will append the line at the end of the file)
	- finally it creates ~/.vim-tmp. This is used to store all .swp files in a central directory.Easier to get rid of them in case of a sudden reboot.


Plugins included:
	- NERDTree
	- rails.vim
	- surround
	- taglist
	- tcomment

These are the main plugins that I use regularly.
For instructions on how to use these refer to the plugin's documentation.
Some other plugins are included at the moment.I didn't include them in the list because I'm thinking of removing them. 

Feel free to fork this repository and change it as you please.
