After cloning a ~/vim_config folder will be created.

Run install.sh to complete instalation.
What this does is :
	- creates a symlink ~/.vim/ -> ~/vim_config # folder used for plugins, docs and colorschemes
	- creates ~/.gvimrc which sources ~/vim_config/vimrc ( if it already exists, it will append the line at the end of the file)
	- creates ~/.vimrc which sources ~/vim_config/vimrc ( if it already exists, it will append the line at the end of the file)
	- finally it creates ~/.vim-tmp. This will be used to store files for persistent undo.


Plugins included:
	- rails.vim
	- surround
	- taglist
    - YankRing
    - fugitive
    - vim-repeat
    - command-t

These are the main plugins that I use regularly.
For instructions on how to use these refer to the plugin's documentation.

Feel free to fork this repository and change it as you please.
